Get up and running (Windows or Mac):

* Install Simple-OpenNI, OpenNI and Processing, following the "instructions provided by Simple-OpenNI":http://code.google.com/p/simple-openni/wiki/Installation (note that on 64-bit Windows, you probably still want the 32-bit OpenNI libraries, since Processing comes with its own 32-bit Java).
* Plug in your Kinect and run the pigeonsim Processing sketch. Alternatively, if you don't have a Kinect, run the pigeon_dummy sketch (and click and drag to bank/steer, [up] to flap, [down] to dive, [space] to go home).
* Launch Chrome with the @--disable-web-security@ command-line flag (to allow cross-domain AJAX requests for the live data), and open web_client/index.html
* Fly!
