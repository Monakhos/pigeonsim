h2. Installation

Pigeon Sim has been tested on Windows 7 and Mac OS 10.7. The Google Earth plugin seems somewhat more stable and less glitchy on Windows -- but this may depend on your graphics card.

* Install Simple-OpenNI, OpenNI and Processing, following the "instructions provided by Simple-OpenNI":http://code.google.com/p/simple-openni/wiki/Installation (note that on 64-bit Windows, you probably still want the 32-bit OpenNI libraries, since Processing comes with its own 32-bit Java).
* Install the "p5websocket (0.1.3+)":http://p5.twelvebytes.net/websocketP5-0.1.3/ library for Processing (i.e. copy it to Documents/Processing/libraries).
* Plug in your Kinect and run the pigeonsim Processing sketch. Alternatively, if you don't have a Kinect, run the pigeon_dummy sketch (and click and drag to bank/steer, [up] to flap, [down] to dive, [space] to go home).
* Launch Chrome with the @--disable-web-security@ command-line flag (to allow cross-domain AJAX requests for the live data), and open web_client/index.html. If you don't already have it, you'll need to agree to install the Google Earth plugin.
* Fly!
